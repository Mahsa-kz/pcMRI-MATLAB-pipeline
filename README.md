# pcMRI-MATLAB-pipeline
This MATLAB code corrects velocity inhomogeneity in phase-contrast MRI (pcMRI), segments a user-selected ROI with a semi-automatic workflow, extracts the ROI velocity waveform, integrates velocity to obtain displacement, and computes both (i) the temporal maximum displacement per voxel and (ii) the spatially maximum displacement within the ROI.
